# Image_Classifier
 Built a CNN model to perform image classification using keras on cifar10 dataset. Performed 2D convolutions, MaxPooling2D, AveragePooling2D. Optimized the network weights using Adam Optimizer. Also, performed network regularization techniques such as Dropout. Evaluated the model, using confusion matrices and classification reports. For enhancing the network generalization capabality, did image augmentation. 

# About the dataset
CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes:

*Airplanes
*Cars
*Birds
*Cats
*Deer
*Dogs
*Frogs
*Horses
*Ships
*Trucks

The dataset stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR)

CIFAR-10 is widely used for machine learning and computer vision applications.
The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images and 6,000 images of each class.
Images have low resolution (32x32).
